I need to delivery the list of customers data to marketing team and crm team.<br/>
So they can use the data to make the promotions on each customer or improve services.

Separate customer into 2 group, because one-time customer cannot do 

<b>one-time customer</b> ( only one transaction )
-    priori-based - segment 1
-    value-based - segment 2
-    need-based - segment 3 <br/>
<b>Note: record of transactions with no customer code will set as one-time customer</b>
     
<b>return customer</b> ( more than one transactions )
-    priori-based - segment 4
-    value-based - segment 5
-    need-based - segment 6 <br/>

Final result is list of customers on each segmentation

<h2>Proceed segmentation</h2><br/>

Select group of clustering
- Using K-means algorithm, so it's need to set the right value of k
- Using <b>simple_kmean</b> program to desire k-mean value 

comparing one-time customer distribution
<pre><code>
SELECT
  CUST_CODE,
  SUM(SPEND) AS TOTAL_SALES,
  COUNT(DISTINCT BASKET_ID) AS TOTAL_VISIT
FROM
  `apiwats-project.my_dataset.my_market`
WHERE
  CUST_CODE IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY
  CUST_CODe
HAVING
  total_visit = 1
UNION ALL
SELECT
  NULL AS cust_code,
  SUM(SPEND) AS TOTAL_SALES,
  COUNT(BASKET_ID) AS TOTAL_VISIT
FROM
  `my_dataset.my_market`
WHERE
  cust_code IS NULL
GROUP BY
  basket_id
</pre></code>

comparing return customer distribution
<pre><code>
SELECT
  CUST_CODE,
  SUM(SPEND) AS TOTAL_SALES,
  COUNT(DISTINCT BASKET_ID) AS TOTAL_VISIT
FROM
  `apiwats-project.my_dataset.my_market`
WHERE
  CUST_CODE IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY
  CUST_CODe
HAVING
  TOTAL_VISIT > 1
ORDER BY
  cust_code;
</pre></code>

Prepare data
- A simple process for these scenarios using Google BigQuery ML and DataStudio
- Import data file into Google Cloud Storage 
- Proceed query in Google BigQuery by connect data from Google CLoud Storage
