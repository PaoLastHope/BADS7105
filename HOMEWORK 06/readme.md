I need to delivery the list of customers data to marketing team and crm team.<br/>
So they can use the data to make the promotions on each customer or improve services.<br/>
To learn characteristics of a product group.
To learn how to reduce cannibalization or improve cross-selling.

Separate customer into 2 group, because one-time customer cannot do 

<b>one-time customer</b> ( only one transaction )
-    priori-based - segment 1
-    value-based - segment 2
-    need-based - segment 3 <br/>
<b>Note: record of transactions with no customer code will set as one-time customer</b>
     
<b>return customer</b> ( more than one transactions )
-    priori-based - segment 4
-    value-based - segment 5
-    need-based - segment 6 <br/>

Final result is list of customers on each segmentation

<h2>Proceed segmentation</h2><br/>

Prepare data
- A simple process for these scenarios using Google BigQuery ML and DataStudio
- Import data file into Google Cloud Storage 
- Connect data from Google Cloud Storage, now we can do query.

Query to retrieve one-time customer ( result = 27,052 )
<pre><code>
SELECT
  CUST_CODE,
  SUM(SPEND) AS TOTAL_SALES,
  COUNT(DISTINCT BASKET_ID) AS TOTAL_VISIT
FROM `apiwats-project.my_dataset.my_market`
WHERE CUST_CODE IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY CUST_CODe
HAVING TOTAL_VISIT = 1
UNION ALL
SELECT
  NULL AS CUST_CODE,
  SUM(SPEND) AS TOTAL_SALES,
  COUNT(DISTINCT BASKET_ID) AS TOTAL_VISIT
FROM `apiwats-project.my_dataset.my_market`
WHERE CUST_CODE IS NULL
GROUP BY BASKET_ID;
</pre></code>


Query to retrieve return customer ( result = 4,075)
<pre><code>
SELECT
  CUST_CODE,
  SUM(SPEND) AS TOTAL_SALES,
  COUNT(DISTINCT BASKET_ID) AS TOTAL_VISIT
FROM `apiwats-project.my_dataset.my_market`
WHERE CUST_CODE IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY CUST_CODE
HAVING TOTAL_VISIT > 1
ORDER BY CUST_CODE;
</pre></code>

Select group of clustering
- Using K-means algorithm on Google BigQuery ML, so it's need to set the right value of k (number of clustering)
- Using <b>simple_kmean</b> program to desire k-mean value 

<b>Comparing one-time customer distribution</b><br/>
Since one-time customer mean they only visit = 1, so we can compare only basket's value <br/>
Starting compare at k=2 to 4, we can see that k=4 the clustering start overapping. So k=3 is the right one. 

<b>Comparing return customer distribution</b>
For roughly choose, we can choose k = 4. At this point, we can see most customers are cleary clustering <br/>
But recommend to choose is k = 7 for deeply focusing on customer's visit or value. And technically, we can grouping back to k = 4
